## Hello there, my name is Valerii 👋

### I am a student and developer

I'm a student for a Master's degree and my major is Software Engineering. I like programming because it seems to me that this activity is creative and strict at
the same time. In addition to taking classes, I have spent my time engaging in different courses and creating
programs for myself. (**I'll rewrite it, probably**) 

⚡ Looking for web-development job opportunities, where React and Node.js are needed.

🔭 I’m currently working as an Appian software developer. I have around 2.5 years of experience in commercial development. 

🌱 I’m currently learning and trying to progress in React, Node.js.

♟️🏋️⛸️ I enjoy playing chess and doing sports, especially ice skating and working out in a gym
