## Hello there, my name is Valerii ðŸ‘‹

### I am a student and developer

I'm a second-year student and my major is Software Engineering. I like programming because it seems to me that this activity is creative and strict at
the same time. In addition to taking classes, I have spent my time engaging in different courses and creating
programs for myself. (**I'll rewrite it, probably**)

ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on this page. 

ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Xamarin 

ðŸ¤” I'm looking for help with a job to start studying programming on real projects

âš¡ Fun fact: I enjoy playing chess and doing sports, especially swimming and working out in a gym

- C#
- .NET
- WPF
